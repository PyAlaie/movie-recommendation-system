# Movie recommendation system

## How to run the project?

After installing the requirements and unziping the datasets, simply run `python3 manage.py build` and then `streamlit run app.py`

## What about this project?

This project is my final project of machine learning course. The goal was to get some experience on working with recommendation systems. The code is simple and easy to read.
